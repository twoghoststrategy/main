Spend about fifteen minutes on the internet reading about starting a business and no one would blame you if you suddenly decided it wasn’t such a great idea after all.\n\nNot every statistic is discouraging, but you must be aware of your chances of success before you devote time, money, and a lot of energy to opening and running your new venture. Even if you’re just selling homemade crafts on Etsy, it’s best to keep your expectations low, your hopes high, and to prepare yourself for a lot of work, a lot of setbacks, and a lot of compromises.\n\nRemember: Just because you have a great idea doesn’t mean it will be a success. You can’t control outside factors like the market, your competition, the economy, and the steady and unrelenting pace of technological disruption.\n\nAll you can do is make decisions based on the best evidence. And even if you devote every hour of your life to your business, there’s still no guarantee that you’ll succeed.\n\nThis is not an attempt to dissuade you from starting a business; there is some good news, after all. We just want to put arm you with the information you’ll need for your journey. The data presented here will help you reduce risk when you can and hopefully make better decisions.\n\n\nFirst, the Good News\n\nThe good news is that you stand on a precipice where many have stood before you.\n\nBy starting a business, you’re engaging in one of the greatest traditions in the history of free society. People respect business owners because they create new opportunities for others and they contribute to their communities, both in terms of culture and wealth. Most businesses start small and never get big, but even those that remain small can become cornerstones of their local communities.\n\nSmall and new businesses also contribute a great deal to the national economy. According to the Small Business Administration (SBA), small businesses generate about 44% of U.S. economic activity. That’s a decent-sized chunk of the pie when you consider the shares some giant companies have in their markets. Amazon maintained 47% of all retail ecommerce sales in 2019. Not everyone gets to be Jeff Bezos.\n\nMost counties and states, as well as the federal government, want to encourage people to start businesses, so there are a lot of benefits available to new entrepreneurs:\n\n * SBA-guaranteed loans and grants\n * Free advice from small business centers\n * Events at your local chamber of commerce\n * Possible tax write-offs and advantages (such as pass-through income)\n * Easy ways to incorporate and organize\n\nSmall businesses employ almost half of the country’s workforce and comprise 99.7% of firms with paid employees.\n\nThanks, entrepreneurs!\n\nNow, are you ready for the bad news?\n\n\nMost New Businesses Fail (Eventually)\n\nOne of the most frequently cited statistics of the past few decades states that half of new businesses fail during their first year. Some pessimistic doomsayers have even cited higher percentages. In 2014, Fortune Magazine reported that 90% of startups fail, which is a grim statistic indeed.\n\nBut according to the SBA and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), these numbers aren’t quite right when you look at them in context.\n\nSBA statistics suggest that about 80% of new businesses survive past their first year of operation. This number has stayed pretty consistent since the ‘90s. It didn’t even change through recessions and other major economic events.\n\nUnfortunately, the chances of your business failing only go up year after year:\n\n(Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics)\n\nThat’s right: About half of all businesses don’t make it past 5 years, around 70% of businesses fail after 10 years, and about 80% of businesses fail eventually. Ouch.\n\nThe BLS doesn’t leave much room for doubt in this area, either, literally stating, “New business establishments make an important contribution to the economy; however, it is inevitable that some of these establishments will eventually fail. The BED [Business Employment Dynamics] age series tracks cohorts of new business establishments to measure how many survive from year to year[...] Survival rates follow a similar path, regardless of the birth year.”\n\nNaturally, businesses tend to “die” more often when the economy is in recession and tend to be “born” more often when the going is good. The numbers also vary by industry. There’s a reason the pizza place in your town is now suddenly a hair salon, and next month it will be an organic grocery.\n\nBut economics and industry trends are just two factors. There are plenty of other reasons a business can fail.\n\nAccording to a study by research and analysis firm CB Insights, most businesses fail for not just one reason, but a combination of them.\n\nWhen asked to select all the factors that caused their failure, 42% of startup owners said it was because there was no market need for their product or service, while 29% failed because they ran out of cash. Other common causes of failure include not hiring the right team (23%), getting outgunned by competitors (19%), pricing and cost issues (18%), and forgetting that, yes, you do need to have a business model if you intend to sell a new product (17%).\n\nOther causes of failure from the study include the following:\n\n * Creating a product that isn’t user-friendly\n * Poor marketing\n * Ignoring customers\n * Launching at the wrong time\n * Lack of focus or passion\n * Disharmony among team members and investors\n * Failed expansions\n * A lack of financing or investor interest\n * Legal problems\n * Burnout\n\nBasically, there are a lot of things that want to kill your business. Starting a business is easy. Growing it and expanding it? That’s when things get complicated.\n\n\nMost Businesses Start at Home — Many Stay There\n\nBased on the most recent statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau, there were over 30 million business establishments in 2017, which means there were also 30 million business owners. If every one of those business owners had employed 5 people, they would have employed the entire U.S. labor force at that time.\n\nIf this doesn’t seem possible, it’s because it isn’t.\n\nThe reality is that most businesses don’t have any employees at all. Only about 7.75 million U.S. businesses had employees on their rosters in 2017. The rest of those businesses represented self-employed people, many of whom work out of their own homes.\n\nOne of the most frequently cited studies about this phenomenon is the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2012 United States Report by Babson and Baruch Colleges, which found that 69% of startups start in people’s homes. The more interesting statistic from the report is that 59% of established businesses were still based in people’s homes.\n\nThat’s an old study, but high-speed internet access has only expanded since 2012 and online marketplaces have boomed.

A 2019 Deloitte survey found that this is especially true among younger employees. Forty-nine percent of Millennials say they intend to leave their current job in 2 years, and 25% of those same respondents had already left a job within the previous 2 years.\n\nA recovering economy, an increasingly educated workforce, and a low unemployment rate have all contributed to this trend. Nothing lasts forever, but the nature of what people want from their work is changing and influencing turnover as well. Few people are happy with just a paycheck — they want opportunities for career advancement, and they want to be recognized for their ideas.\n\nA Gallup study showed that 79% of employees leave their jobs not because they aren’t making enough money but because they aren’t being appreciated. Despite how you might feel about holding your employees’ hands and singing kumbaya, this is the new reality.\n\nTo reduce turnover, you’ll need to prioritize the following:\n\n * Develop a hiring process that gets the right people through your door\n * Offer attractive benefits packages\n * Provide opportunities for ongoing education and cross-training\n * Enable employees to share their ideas\n * Recognize employee excellence\n * Create company traditions and establish a set of values\n * Create flexible start and end times for workdays\n * Allow employees to work from home, if possible\n * Ensure employees understand their roles and responsibilities\n * Stand for something beyond profit\n\nIf you’re just starting your business, you probably don’t have an HR department to back you up.

Many startups offer their employees stock options to sweeten the deal and build a team atmosphere.\n\n\nNo One’s Going to Get Rich Quick\n\nYou may have heard stories of unicorn startups being bought up by big companies, their bright-eyed CEOs retiring early and sailing off into the sunset on their mega-yachts at the ripe old age of 34.\n\nIf you’re starting a business with the goal of getting rich quick, you aren’t going into business for the right reasons.\n\nThis isn’t to say that this doesn’t happen; it just happens so infrequently that it’s on par with winning millions on a scratch ticket or signing up your garage band with a big record label before you reach the legal drinking age.\n\nMost studies indicate that entrepreneurs tend to make a yearly salary that’s above average, but they certainly don’t have swimming pools filled with Spanish Doubloons. American Express OPEN found that more than half of entrepreneurs paid themselves a full-time salary of $68,000 in 2017.\n\nThat’s a decent salary by most standards, but it doesn’t suggest starting a business is a direct path to Easy Street. Successful entrepreneurs tend to start businesses for other reasons, like the desire for professional freedom or the urge to fill a need in the market with a new idea.","html":"<p>There’s a reason people’s eyes tend to glaze over when someone dives into a long sermon about their new startup.</p><p>When you start a business, the odds just aren’t in your favor — and the evidence is everywhere. Spend about fifteen minutes on the internet reading about starting a business and no one would blame you if you suddenly decided it wasn’t such a great idea after all.</p><p>Not every statistic is discouraging, but you must be aware of your chances of success before you devote time, money, and a lot of energy to opening and running your new venture. Even if you’re just selling homemade crafts on Etsy, it’s best to keep your expectations low, your hopes high, and to prepare yourself for a lot of work, a lot of setbacks, and a lot of compromises.</p><p>Remember: Just because you have a great idea doesn’t mean it will be a success. You can’t control outside factors like the market, your competition, the economy, and the steady and unrelenting pace of technological disruption.</p><p>All you can do is make decisions based on the best evidence. And even if you devote every hour of your life to your business, there’s still no guarantee that you’ll succeed.</p><p>This is not an attempt to dissuade you from starting a business; there is some good news, after all. We just want to put arm you with the information you’ll need for your journey. The data presented here will help you reduce risk when you can and hopefully make better decisions.</p><h2 id=\"first-the-good-news\"><strong>First, the Good News</strong></h2><p>The good news is that you stand on a precipice where many have stood before you.</p><p>By starting a business, you’re engaging in one of the greatest traditions in the history of free society. People respect business owners because they create new opportunities for others and they contribute to their communities, both in terms of culture and wealth. Most businesses start small and never get big, but even those that remain small can become cornerstones of their local communities.</p><p>Small and new businesses also contribute a great deal to the national economy. According to the Small Business Administration (SBA), small businesses generate about 44% of U.S. economic activity. That’s a decent-sized chunk of the pie when you consider the shares some giant companies have in their markets. Amazon maintained 47% of all retail ecommerce sales in 2019. Not everyone gets to be Jeff Bezos.</p><p>Most counties and states, as well as the federal government, want to encourage people to start businesses, so there are a lot of benefits available to new entrepreneurs:</p><ul><li>SBA-guaranteed loans and grants</li><li>Free advice from small business centers</li><li>Events at your local chamber of commerce</li><li>Possible tax write-offs and advantages (such as pass-through income)</li><li>Easy ways to incorporate and organize</li></ul><p>Small businesses employ almost half of the country’s workforce and comprise 99.7% of firms with paid employees.</p><p>Thanks, entrepreneurs!</p><p>Now, are you ready for the bad news?</p><h2 id=\"most-new-businesses-fail-eventually\"><strong>Most New Businesses Fail (Eventually)</strong></h2><p>One of the most frequently cited statistics of the past few decades states that half of new businesses fail during their first year. Some pessimistic doomsayers have even cited higher percentages. In 2014, Fortune Magazine reported that 90% of startups fail, which is a grim statistic indeed.</p><p>But according to the SBA and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), these numbers aren’t quite right when you look at them in context.</p><p>SBA statistics suggest that about 80% of new businesses survive past their first year of operation. This number has stayed pretty consistent since the ‘90s. It didn’t even change through recessions and other major economic events.</p><p>Unfortunately, the chances of your business failing only go up year after year:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_C2B868CB6E7DD243AAF6A4A278CDF2C74EEF5B9B1351FB1E5768E6BF905A1A0E_1571544345816_Business+Survival+Rate+Chart.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>(Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics)</p><p>That’s right: About half of all businesses don’t make it past 5 years, around 70% of businesses fail after 10 years, and about 80% of businesses fail eventually. Ouch.</p><p>The BLS doesn’t leave much room for doubt in this area, either, literally stating, “New business establishments make an important contribution to the economy; however, it is inevitable that some of these establishments will eventually fail. The BED [Business Employment Dynamics] age series tracks cohorts of new business establishments to measure how many survive from year to year[...] Survival rates follow a similar path, regardless of the birth year.”</p><p>Naturally, businesses tend to “die” more often when the economy is in recession and tend to be “born” more often when the going is good. The numbers also vary by industry. There’s a reason the pizza place in your town is now suddenly a hair salon, and next month it will be an organic grocery.</p><p>But economics and industry trends are just two factors. There are plenty of other reasons a business can fail.</p><p>According to a study by research and analysis firm CB Insights, most businesses fail for not just one reason, but a combination of them.</p><p>When asked to select all the factors that caused their failure, 42% of startup owners said it was because there was no market need for their product or service, while 29% failed because they ran out of cash. Other common causes of failure include not hiring the right team (23%), getting outgunned by competitors (19%), pricing and cost issues (18%), and forgetting that, yes, you do need to have a business model if you intend to sell a new product (17%).</p><p>Other causes of failure from the study include the following:</p><ul><li>Creating a product that isn’t user-friendly</li><li>Poor marketing</li><li>Ignoring customers</li><li>Launching at the wrong time</li><li>Lack of focus or passion</li><li>Disharmony among team members and investors</li><li>Failed expansions</li><li>A lack of financing or investor interest</li><li>Legal problems</li><li>Burnout</li></ul><p>Basically, there are a lot of things that want to kill your business. Starting a business is easy. Growing it and expanding it? That’s when things get complicated.</p><h2 id=\"most-businesses-start-at-home-%E2%80%94-many-stay-there\"><strong>Most Businesses Start at Home — Many Stay There</strong></h2><p>Based on the most recent statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau, there were over 30 million business establishments in 2017, which means there were also 30 million business owners. If every one of those business owners had employed 5 people, they would have employed the entire U.S. labor force at that time.</p><p>If this doesn’t seem possible, it’s because it isn’t.</p><p>The reality is that most businesses don’t have any employees at all. Only about 7.75 million U.S. businesses had employees on their rosters in 2017. The rest of those businesses represented self-employed people, many of whom work out of their own homes.</p><p>One of the most frequently cited studies about this phenomenon is the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2012 United States Report by Babson and Baruch Colleges, which found that 69% of startups start in people’s homes.

You can stumble across what are often considered to be respectable conversion rates in the single digits.\n\nDifferent lengths and types of content appeal to different users, and it is important to populate your website and blog with these types of content in order to reach the widest audience possible. Here are the four types of internet users along with the content that appeals to each.\n\n\nStreakers\n\nStreakers are just what they sound like. These are internet users who are streaking through a search on the net, looking for a quick answer or a fast solution to a problem. They are often looking to make a purchase whether pre-planned or impulse and are just following through on a decision they’ve already made.\n\nAlternatively, they are looking for a simple answer such as “How long do you boil an egg?” The key to getting this user’s attention is to have the best answer to their question, or the quickest and best checkout with the briefest product description.\n\nWhile studies show that if a web page takes more than four seconds to load, the user will go somewhere else for answers, with the streaker it is often even quicker than that. You have only a second or two to get and hold their attention, and in order to earn a click in the first place, you must be in one of the top spots on Google. Users who go to page 2 are rare, but streakers never do.\n\nShort form content, fast loading pages, quick answers, simple shopping and checkout features, brief product descriptions, and short video clips and even small infographics or photo essays all appeal to streakers. Content that takes just a moment to browse and understand is the best way to reach them.\n\n\nStrollers\n\nStrollers are not in a huge hurry like their streaker counterparts, however, they are also not invested in a multiple-thread, lengthy search. Sometimes a stroller does not exactly know what they are looking for yet. They are at the point in the sales funnel where they know they have a want or need but have no clue what the solution might be.\n\nIn some cases, they may also not know they have a want or need, and by attracting their attention, you may be able to show it to them. Think of the stroller as a window shopper. Your objective is to attract and hold their attention.\n\nThe thing about strollers is that they are easily distracted. Appealing to them means medium form, medium length content, but it must also be well-written and informative content that is visually appealing and accurate. They will get bored with content that is too long and will close tabs quickly on content that is superficial.\n\n\nStudiers\n\nThe studier is different. This is a person who knows they have a want or a need but is into looking at all of their options. Price is not a factor for them in most cases, but features, reviews, detailed descriptions, and comparisons to similar products matter more.\n\nThis is the user who often conducts multi-thread searches with different keywords and phrases they use to narrow the results. Well-written long-form content goes a long way. Fluff content will earn a bounce and a “never visit your site again” result.\n\nThe kicker is as these users search and study, they are more likely to share or link to your content than others. Not only are they vested in their own solutions, they often like to share these solutions with others. If your content appeals to them and you have a good product to back it up, they will become your greatest ambassadors. Let them down, and well, things will go the opposite direction.\n\nStudiers may leave your site and return after more research. Being an expert on your subject and providing informative content is the key to winning them over.\n\n\nResearchers\n\nResearchers are the least common type of internet users, almost studiers on steroids. They are often students, journalists, or academics. They will share your content, but they are looking for fact-based and source backed materials. White papers, case studies, long-form articles, in-depth tutorials, and more appeal to them.\n\nYour site will often earn links from researchers, as they will cite your work if it is authoritative enough yet engaging. These links will often be from high-authority sites that will boost your Google rankings and increase organic traffic. These links are typically relevant, and can actually earn you direct clicks too.\n\nThe idea behind knowing these users is to understand that you can structure content to appeal to them, but ideally you will convert streakers to strollers, slowing them down on your site. You will convert strollers to studiers, and studiers to researchers.\n\nAs you understand these types, you will better understand your marketing personas. This understanding will help you formulate and execute a content marketing strategy that will yield real results.\n\nYou can either stumble across decent conversion numbers, or you can be a rock star by appealing to all of the types of internet users, making your content desirable to all of them.","html":"<p>If you have no idea what (or who) you are aiming for, you won’t even know if you hit them.
