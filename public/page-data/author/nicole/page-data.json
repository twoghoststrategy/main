You can stumble across what are often considered to be respectable\nconversion rates in the single digits.\n\nDifferent lengths and types of content appeal to different users, and it is\nimportant to populate your website and blog with these types of content in order\nto reach the widest audience possible. Here are the four types of internet users\nalong with the content that appeals to each.\n\nStreakers\nStreakers are just what they sound like. These are internet users who are\nstreaking through a search on the net, looking for a quick answer or a fast\nsolution to a problem. They are often looking to make a purchase whether\npre-planned or impulse and are just following through on a decision they’ve\nalready made.\n\nAlternatively, they are looking for a simple answer such as “How long do you\nboil an egg?” The key to getting this user’s attention is to have the best\nanswer to their question, or the quickest and best checkout with the briefest\nproduct description.\n\nWhile studies show that if a web page takes more than four seconds to load, the\nuser will go somewhere else for answers, with the streaker it is often even\nquicker than that. You have only a second or two to get and hold their\nattention, and in order to earn a click in the first place, you must be in one\nof the top spots on Google. Users who go to page 2 are rare, but streakers never\ndo.\n\nShort form content, fast loading pages, quick answers, simple shopping and\ncheckout features, brief product descriptions, and short video clips and even\nsmall infographics or photo essays all appeal to streakers. Content that takes\njust a moment to browse and understand is the best way to reach them.\n\nStrollers\nStrollers are not in a huge hurry like their streaker counterparts, however,\nthey are also not invested in a multiple-thread, lengthy search. Sometimes a\nstroller does not exactly know what they are looking for yet. They are at the\npoint in the sales funnel where they know they have a want or need but have no\nclue what the solution might be.\n\nIn some cases, they may also not know they have a want or need, and by\nattracting their attention, you may be able to show it to them. Think of the\nstroller as a window shopper. Your objective is to attract and hold their\nattention.\n\nThe thing about strollers is that they are easily distracted. Appealing to them\nmeans medium form, medium length content, but it must also be well-written and\ninformative content that is visually appealing and accurate. They will get bored\nwith content that is too long and will close tabs quickly on content that is\nsuperficial.\n\nStudiers\nThe studier is different. This is a person who knows they have a want or a need\nbut is into looking at all of their options. Price is not a factor for them in\nmost cases, but features, reviews, detailed descriptions, and comparisons to\nsimilar products matter more.\n\nThis is the user who often conducts multi-thread searches with different\nkeywords and phrases they use to narrow the results. Well-written long-form\ncontent goes a long way. Fluff content will earn a bounce and a “never visit\nyour site again” result.\n\nThe kicker is as these users search and study, they are more likely to share or\nlink to your content than others. Not only are they vested in their own\nsolutions, they often like to share these solutions with others. If your content\nappeals to them and you have a good product to back it up, they will become your\ngreatest ambassadors. Let them down, and well, things will go the opposite\ndirection.\n\nStudiers may leave your site and return after more research. Being an expert on\nyour subject and providing informative content is the key to winning them over.\n\nResearchers\nResearchers are the least common type of internet users, almost studiers on\nsteroids. They are often students, journalists, or academics. They will share\nyour content, but they are looking for fact-based and source backed materials.\nWhite papers, case studies, long-form articles, in-depth tutorials, and more\nappeal to them.\n\nYour site will often earn links from researchers, as they will cite your work if\nit is authoritative enough yet engaging. These links will often be from\nhigh-authority sites that will boost your Google rankings and increase organic\ntraffic. These links are typically relevant, and can actually earn you direct\nclicks too.\n\nThe idea behind knowing these users is to understand that you can structure\ncontent to appeal to them, but ideally you will convert streakers to strollers,\nslowing them down on your site. You will convert strollers to studiers, and\nstudiers to researchers.\n\nAs you understand these types, you will better understand your marketing\npersonas. This understanding will help you formulate and execute a content\nmarketing strategy that will yield real results.\n\nYou can either stumble across decent conversion numbers, or you can be a rock\nstar by appealing to all of the types of internet users, making your content\ndesirable to all of them.","html":"<p><br><br>If you have no idea what (or who) you are aiming for, you won’t even know if you hit them.

And even if you\ndevote every hour of your life to your business, there’s still no guarantee that\nyou’ll succeed.\n\nThis is not an attempt to dissuade you from starting a business; there is some\ngood news, after all. We just want to put arm you with the information you’ll\nneed for your journey. The data presented here will help you reduce risk when\nyou can and hopefully make better decisions.\n\nFirst, the Good News\nThe good news is that you stand on a precipice where many have stood before you.\n\nBy starting a business, you’re engaging in one of the greatest traditions in the\nhistory of free society. People respect business owners because they create new\nopportunities for others and they contribute to their communities, both in terms\nof culture and wealth. Most businesses start small and never get big, but even\nthose that remain small can become cornerstones of their local communities.\n\nSmall and new businesses also contribute a great deal to the national economy.\nAccording to the Small Business Administration (SBA), small businesses generate\nabout 44% of U.S. economic activity. That’s a decent-sized chunk of the pie when\nyou consider the shares some giant companies have in their markets. Amazon\nmaintained 47% of all retail ecommerce sales in 2019. Not everyone gets to be\nJeff Bezos.\n\nMost counties and states, as well as the federal government, want to encourage\npeople to start businesses, so there are a lot of benefits available to new\nentrepreneurs:\n\n * SBA-guaranteed loans and grants\n * Free advice from small business centers\n * Events at your local chamber of commerce\n * Possible tax write-offs and advantages (such as pass-through income)\n * Easy ways to incorporate and organize\n\nSmall businesses employ almost half of the country’s workforce and comprise\n99.7% of firms with paid employees.\n\nThanks, entrepreneurs!\n\nNow, are you ready for the bad news?\n\nMost New Businesses Fail (Eventually)\nOne of the most frequently cited statistics of the past few decades states that\nhalf of new businesses fail during their first year. Some pessimistic doomsayers\nhave even cited higher percentages. In 2014, Fortune Magazine reported that 90%\nof startups fail, which is a grim statistic indeed.\n\nBut according to the SBA and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), these numbers\naren’t quite right when you look at them in context.\n\nSBA statistics suggest that about 80% of new businesses survive past their first\nyear of operation. This number has stayed pretty consistent since the ‘90s. It\ndidn’t even change through recessions and other major economic events.\n\nUnfortunately, the chances of your business failing only go up year after year:\n\n(Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics)\n\nThat’s right: About half of all businesses don’t make it past 5 years, around\n70% of businesses fail after 10 years, and about 80% of businesses fail\neventually. Ouch.\n\nThe BLS doesn’t leave much room for doubt in this area, either, literally\nstating, “New business establishments make an important contribution to the\neconomy; however, it is inevitable that some of these establishments will\neventually fail. The BED [Business Employment Dynamics] age series tracks\ncohorts of new business establishments to measure how many survive from year to\nyear[...] Survival rates follow a similar path, regardless of the birth year.”\n\nNaturally, businesses tend to “die” more often when the economy is in recession\nand tend to be “born” more often when the going is good. The numbers also vary\nby industry. There’s a reason the pizza place in your town is now suddenly a\nhair salon, and next month it will be an organic grocery.\n\nBut economics and industry trends are just two factors. There are plenty of\nother reasons a business can fail.\n\nAccording to a study by research and analysis firm CB Insights, most businesses\nfail for not just one reason, but a combination of them.\n\nWhen asked to select all the factors that caused their failure, 42% of startup\nowners said it was because there was no market need for their product or\nservice, while 29% failed because they ran out of cash. Other common causes of\nfailure include not hiring the right team (23%), getting outgunned by\ncompetitors (19%), pricing and cost issues (18%), and forgetting that, yes, you\ndo need to have a business model if you intend to sell a new product (17%).\n\nOther causes of failure from the study include the following:\n\n * Creating a product that isn’t user-friendly\n * Poor marketing\n * Ignoring customers\n * Launching at the wrong time\n * Lack of focus or passion\n * Disharmony among team members and investors\n * Failed expansions\n * A lack of financing or investor interest\n * Legal problems\n * Burnout\n\nBasically, there are a lot of things that want to kill your business. Starting a\nbusiness is easy. Growing it and expanding it? That’s when things get\ncomplicated.\n\nMost Businesses Start at Home — Many Stay There\nBased on the most recent statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau, there were over\n30 million business establishments in 2017, which means there were also 30\nmillion business owners. If every one of those business owners had employed 5\npeople, they would have employed the entire U.S. labor force at that time.\n\nIf this doesn’t seem possible, it’s because it isn’t.\n\nThe reality is that most businesses don’t have any employees at all. Only about\n7.75 million U.S. businesses had employees on their rosters in 2017. The rest of\nthose businesses represented self-employed people, many of whom work out of\ntheir own homes.\n\nOne of the most frequently cited studies about this phenomenon is the Global\nEntrepreneurship Monitor 2012 United States Report by Babson and Baruch\nColleges, which found that 69% of startups start in people’s homes. The more\ninteresting statistic from the report is that 59% of established businesses were\nstill based in people’s homes.\n\nThat’s an old study, but high-speed internet access has only expanded since 2012\nand online marketplaces have boomed. Today, you can start a home-based business\nwith nothing but a MacBook and an internet connection.\n\nThis trend also makes sense given the high costs associated with starting a\ntraditional brick and mortar business. In addition to startup costs, there’s\nrent, new technologies, employee overhead, marketing, and more.\n\nIf you’re starting your business from your living room with visions of making it\nbig, keep in mind that you may still be running operations in your pajama pants\na year or two down the line. There are ways to expand quickly, like raising\ncapital or taking out a loan, but it all depends on your tolerance for risk.\n\nMost Business Owners Work Way More Than 40 Hours Each Week\nIf you know anyone who owns a business, you don’t even need studies to verify\nthis. But one common mistake new entrepreneurs make is assuming they’ll be able\nto work fewer hours because they can delegate their responsibilities to others\nand make their own schedules.\n\nWhile this isn’t unheard of, it’s a rarity when you look at the numbers. The\nBureau of Labor Statistics found that the majority of small-business owners work\nat least 50 hours per week, while 25% said they work more than 60.\n\nMost Businesses Are Struggling to Retain Employees\nIn the 20th century, it wasn’t unheard of for someone to stay at the same\ncompany for 40 years, build themselves a nice middle-class life, then retire\nwith a pension.\n\nTimes have changed.\n\nFew people today expect their employers to take care of them, and fewer still\nare satisfied enough with their jobs to stay longer than a few years. A 2019\nDeloitte survey found that this is especially true among younger employees.\nForty-nine percent of Millennials say they intend to leave their current job in\n2 years, and 25% of those same respondents had already left a job within the\nprevious 2 years.\n\nA recovering economy, an increasingly educated workforce, and a low unemployment\nrate have all contributed to this trend. Nothing lasts forever, but the nature\nof what people want from their work is changing and influencing turnover as\nwell. Few people are happy with just a paycheck — they want opportunities for\ncareer advancement, and they want to be recognized for their ideas.\n\nA Gallup study showed that 79% of employees leave their jobs not because they\naren’t making enough money but because they aren’t being appreciated. Despite\nhow you might feel about holding your employees’ hands and singing kumbaya, this\nis the new reality.\n\nTo reduce turnover, you’ll need to prioritize the following:\n\n * Develop a hiring process that gets the right people through your door\n * Offer attractive benefits packages\n * Provide opportunities for ongoing education and cross-training\n * Enable employees to share their ideas\n * Recognize employee excellence\n * Create company traditions and establish a set of values\n * Create flexible start and end times for workdays\n * Allow employees to work from home, if possible\n * Ensure employees understand their roles and responsibilities\n * Stand for something beyond profit\n\nIf you’re just starting your business, you probably don’t have an HR department\nto back you up. Start with the basics, like an employee health plan and a\n401(k). Many startups offer their employees stock options to sweeten the deal\nand build a team atmosphere.\n\nNo One’s Going to Get Rich Quick\nYou may have heard stories of unicorn startups being bought up by big companies,\ntheir bright-eyed CEOs retiring early and sailing off into the sunset on their\nmega-yachts at the ripe old age of 34.\n\nIf you’re starting a business with the goal of getting rich quick, you aren’t\ngoing into business for the right reasons.\n\nThis isn’t to say that this doesn’t happen; it just happens so infrequently that\nit’s on par with winning millions on a scratch ticket or signing up your garage\nband with a big record label before you reach the legal drinking age.\n\nMost studies indicate that entrepreneurs tend to make a yearly salary that’s\nabove average, but they certainly don’t have swimming pools filled with Spanish\nDoubloons. American Express OPEN found that more than half of entrepreneurs paid\nthemselves a full-time salary of $68,000 in 2017.\n\nThat’s a decent salary by most standards, but it doesn’t suggest starting a\nbusiness is a direct path to Easy Street. Successful entrepreneurs tend to start\nbusinesses for other reasons, like the desire for professional freedom or the\nurge to fill a need in the market with a new idea.","html":"<p>There’s a reason people’s eyes tend to glaze over when someone dives into a long sermon about their new startup.</p><p>When you start a business, the odds just aren’t in your favor — and the evidence is everywhere.

It didn’t even change through recessions and other major economic events.</p><p>Unfortunately, the chances of your business failing only go up year after year:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_C2B868CB6E7DD243AAF6A4A278CDF2C74EEF5B9B1351FB1E5768E6BF905A1A0E_1571544345816_Business+Survival+Rate+Chart.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>(Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics)</p><p>That’s right: About half of all businesses don’t make it past 5 years, around 70% of businesses fail after 10 years, and about 80% of businesses fail eventually. Ouch.</p><p>The BLS doesn’t leave much room for doubt in this area, either, literally stating, “New business establishments make an important contribution to the economy; however, it is inevitable that some of these establishments will eventually fail. The BED [Business Employment Dynamics] age series tracks cohorts of new business establishments to measure how many survive from year to year[...] Survival rates follow a similar path, regardless of the birth year.”</p><p>Naturally, businesses tend to “die” more often when the economy is in recession and tend to be “born” more often when the going is good. The numbers also vary by industry. There’s a reason the pizza place in your town is now suddenly a hair salon, and next month it will be an organic grocery.</p><p>But economics and industry trends are just two factors. There are plenty of other reasons a business can fail.</p><p>According to a study by research and analysis firm CB Insights, most businesses fail for not just one reason, but a combination of them.</p><p>When asked to select all the factors that caused their failure, 42% of startup owners said it was because there was no market need for their product or service, while 29% failed because they ran out of cash. Other common causes of failure include not hiring the right team (23%), getting outgunned by competitors (19%), pricing and cost issues (18%), and forgetting that, yes, you do need to have a business model if you intend to sell a new product (17%).</p><p>Other causes of failure from the study include the following:</p><ul><li>Creating a product that isn’t user-friendly</li><li>Poor marketing</li><li>Ignoring customers</li><li>Launching at the wrong time</li><li>Lack of focus or passion</li><li>Disharmony among team members and investors</li><li>Failed expansions</li><li>A lack of financing or investor interest</li><li>Legal problems</li><li>Burnout</li></ul><p>Basically, there are a lot of things that want to kill your business. Starting a business is easy. Growing it and expanding it? That’s when things get complicated.</p><h2 id=\"most-businesses-start-at-home-%E2%80%94-many-stay-there\">Most Businesses Start at Home — Many Stay There</h2><p>Based on the most recent statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau, there were over 30 million business establishments in 2017, which means there were also 30 million business owners. If every one of those business owners had employed 5 people, they would have employed the entire U.S. labor force at that time.</p><p>If this doesn’t seem possible, it’s because it isn’t.</p><p>The reality is that most businesses don’t have any employees at all. Only about 7.75 million U.S. businesses had employees on their rosters in 2017. The rest of those businesses represented self-employed people, many of whom work out of their own homes.</p><p>One of the most frequently cited studies about this phenomenon is the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2012 United States Report by Babson and Baruch Colleges, which found that 69% of startups start in people’s homes. The more interesting statistic from the report is that 59% of established businesses were still based in people’s homes.</p><p>That’s an old study, but high-speed internet access has only expanded since 2012 and online marketplaces have boomed. Today, you can start a home-based business with nothing but a MacBook and an internet connection.</p><p>This trend also makes sense given the high costs associated with starting a traditional brick and mortar business. In addition to startup costs, there’s rent, new technologies, employee overhead, marketing, and more.</p><p>If you’re starting your business from your living room with visions of making it big, keep in mind that you may still be running operations in your pajama pants a year or two down the line. There are ways to expand quickly, like raising capital or taking out a loan, but it all depends on your tolerance for risk.</p><h2 id=\"most-business-owners-work-way-more-than-40-hours-each-week\">Most Business Owners Work Way More Than 40 Hours Each Week</h2><p>If you know anyone who owns a business, you don’t even need studies to verify this. But one common mistake new entrepreneurs make is assuming they’ll be able to work fewer hours because they can delegate their responsibilities to others and make their own schedules.</p><p>While this isn’t unheard of, it’s a rarity when you look at the numbers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that the majority of small-business owners work at least 50 hours per week, while 25% said they work more than 60.</p><h2 id=\"most-businesses-are-struggling-to-retain-employees\">Most Businesses Are Struggling to Retain Employees</h2><p>In the 20th century, it wasn’t unheard of for someone to stay at the same company for 40 years, build themselves a nice middle-class life, then retire with a pension.</p><p>Times have changed.</p><p>Few people today expect their employers to take care of them, and fewer still are satisfied enough with their jobs to stay longer than a few years. A 2019 Deloitte survey found that this is especially true among younger employees. Forty-nine percent of Millennials say they intend to leave their current job in 2 years, and 25% of those same respondents had already left a job within the previous 2 years.</p><p>A recovering economy, an increasingly educated workforce, and a low unemployment rate have all contributed to this trend. Nothing lasts forever, but the nature of what people want from their work is changing and influencing turnover as well. Few people are happy with just a paycheck — they want opportunities for career advancement, and they want to be recognized for their ideas.</p><p>A Gallup study showed that 79% of employees leave their jobs not because they aren’t making enough money but because they aren’t being appreciated. Despite how you might feel about holding your employees’ hands and singing kumbaya, this is the new reality.</p><p>To reduce turnover, you’ll need to prioritize the following:</p><ul><li>Develop a hiring process that gets the right people through your door</li><li>Offer attractive benefits packages</li><li>Provide opportunities for ongoing education and cross-training</li><li>Enable employees to share their ideas</li><li>Recognize employee excellence</li><li>Create company traditions and establish a set of values</li><li>Create flexible start and end times for workdays</li><li>Allow employees to work from home, if possible</li><li>Ensure employees understand their roles and responsibilities</li><li>Stand for something beyond profit</li></ul><p>If you’re just starting your business, you probably don’t have an HR department to back you up. Start with the basics, like an employee health plan and a 401(k). Many startups offer their employees stock options to sweeten the deal and build a team atmosphere.</p><h2 id=\"no-one%E2%80%99s-going-to-get-rich-quick\">No One’s Going to Get Rich Quick</h2><p>You may have heard stories of unicorn startups being bought up by big companies, their bright-eyed CEOs retiring early and sailing off into the sunset on their mega-yachts at the ripe old age of 34.</p><p>If you’re starting a business with the goal of getting rich quick, you aren’t going into business for the right reasons.</p><p>This isn’t to say that this doesn’t happen; it just happens so infrequently that it’s on par with winning millions on a scratch ticket or signing up your garage band with a big record label before you reach the legal drinking age.</p><p>Most studies indicate that entrepreneurs tend to make a yearly salary that’s above average, but they certainly don’t have swimming pools filled with Spanish Doubloons. American Express OPEN found that more than half of entrepreneurs paid themselves a full-time salary of $68,000 in 2017.</p><p>That’s a decent salary by most standards, but it doesn’t suggest starting a business is a direct path to Easy Street. Successful entrepreneurs tend to start businesses for other reasons, like the desire for professional freedom or the urge to fill a need in the market with a new idea.</p>","url":"https://blog.oakwave.com/the-somewhat-grim-statistics-of-starting-a-new-business/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"c1f9cd06-23b8-4882-b5e0-2bc569bf01bc","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"60c3dad3223688243ba0e0ae","reading_time":8}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__60c3db8b223688243ba0e0bf","title":"What are some hard truths about running a business?","slug":"what-are-some-hard-truths-about-running-a-business","featured":false,"feature_image":null,"excerpt":"\n\n 1.

Basically, a client is paying a lower price for access to a\ntemplate, or formula, by which they can execute their marketing. Since this\ntemplate has literally zero emotional connection with the target audience and is\nreused over and over and over, it is effective at the moment it is being\nexecuted (if the odds are in your favor) and ineffective in building the brand\nor anything with staying power. There are exceptions to this, but they are just\nthat, diamonds in the rough. It does not build the brand behind the marketing or\nproliferate a unique differentiation. Why is that important? Authors greater\nthan me have written literal tomes about the necessity of competitive\ndifferentiation.\n\nThere's an old adage about being an inch deep and a mile wide versus a mile deep\nand an inch wide.  In marketing, it was always meant to be a mile wide and inch\ndeep.  If you put all of your eggs in one basket, one approach, chances are high\nthat the tech will change or the market will change or the industry will change\nor something will break everything.\n\nIn marketing, and in business, you never allow yourself in a position in which\nall of your leads will be cut off in one swoop.  When did that become\nacceptable?  Campaigns were born from the idea of attacking on multiple fronts\nwith a unified message.  Attacking on one or two fronts with a varied message?\n Or no real message at all?  How does that make any sense?  Even if you have the\nsame message, you still are putting all your eggs in one basket.  That's not\njust bad marketing, that's bad business.\n\nThe moment we start commoditizing and templating what should be more creativity\nthan anything is the moment we destroy it.\n\nWhat happens in 99% of these templated relationships is that the client ends up\npaying for something that they can barely afford or understand.  It\\ yields\nlittle to no lasting results, or mediocre results that stop as soon as they stop\npaying. There is no originality in any of their advertising or campaigns. There\nis no genuine thought leadership. Hell, there is no original thought. It’s\nmarketing on the rinse-and-repeat cycle.\n\nWhat was and still could be the industry with the most opportunity to evolve our\nsociety as a whole, is also the one responsible for society’s regression.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked the \"long answer,\" check out the book written by our CEO, Bad\nMarketing:  Our industry is turning into a monster!\n[https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Marketing-industry-turning-monster-ebook/dp/B08511CSC4/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=bad+marketing&qid=1582857549&sr=8-2]","html":"<p></p><p></p><p><strong>The Short Answer:</strong><br>All of them, but we specialize in B2B (though we have had MANY B2C clients as well, it’s just not our core strength).  We have a penchant for franchise sales, SaaS, medical, and manufacturing.  But, only because we’ve had clusters of clients in each of those areas.  As long as the nature of the challenge is marketing, sales, or business, we’re specialized there.  This requires a lot more work on our part, but we know your industry like our own by the end of our process.</p><p><strong>The Long Answer:</strong><br>We don’t specialize.  In a specialized agency relationship, the client pays the ultimate price.

Authors greater than me have written literal tomes about the necessity of competitive differentiation.</p><p>There's an old adage about being an inch deep and a mile wide versus a mile deep and an inch wide.  In marketing, it was always meant to be a mile wide and inch deep.  If you put all of your eggs in one basket, one approach, chances are high that the tech will change or the market will change or the industry will change or something will break everything.</p><p>In marketing, and in business, you never allow yourself in a position in which all of your leads will be cut off in one swoop.  When did that become acceptable?  Campaigns were born from the idea of attacking on multiple fronts with a unified message.  Attacking on one or two fronts with a varied message?  Or no real message at all?  How does that make any sense?  Even if you have the same message, you still are putting all your eggs in one basket.  That's not just bad marketing, that's bad business.</p><p>The moment we start commoditizing and templating what should be more creativity than anything is the moment we destroy it.</p><p>What happens in 99% of these templated relationships is that the client ends up paying for something that they can barely afford or understand.  It\\ yields little to no lasting results, or mediocre results that stop as soon as they stop paying. There is no originality in any of their advertising or campaigns. There is no genuine thought leadership. Hell, there is no original thought. It’s marketing on the rinse-and-repeat cycle.</p><p>What was and still could be the industry with the most opportunity to evolve our society as a whole, is also the one responsible for society’s regression.</p><hr><p>If you liked the \"long answer,\" check out the book written by our CEO, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Marketing-industry-turning-monster-ebook/dp/B08511CSC4/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=bad+marketing&amp;qid=1582857549&amp;sr=8-2\">Bad Marketing:  Our industry is turning into a monster!</a></p>","url":"https://blog.oakwave.com/what-industries-does-oakwave-service/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"786d7677-d775-4640-ad2f-22161dc46b44","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"60c3dbd3223688243ba0e0c7","reading_time":2}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__60c3dd12223688243ba0e0e9","title":"What is Human Marketing?","slug":"what-is-human-marketing","featured":false,"feature_image":null,"excerpt":"We truly believe in the idea of human marketing.
