There are exceptions to this, but they are just\nthat, diamonds in the rough. It does not build the brand behind the marketing or\nproliferate a unique differentiation. Why is that important? Authors greater\nthan me have written literal tomes about the necessity of competitive\ndifferentiation.\n\nThere's an old adage about being an inch deep and a mile wide versus a mile deep\nand an inch wide.  In marketing, it was always meant to be a mile wide and inch\ndeep.  If you put all of your eggs in one basket, one approach, chances are high\nthat the tech will change or the market will change or the industry will change\nor something will break everything.\n\nIn marketing, and in business, you never allow yourself in a position in which\nall of your leads will be cut off in one swoop.  When did that become\nacceptable?  Campaigns were born from the idea of attacking on multiple fronts\nwith a unified message.  Attacking on one or two fronts with a varied message?\n Or no real message at all?  How does that make any sense?  Even if you have the\nsame message, you still are putting all your eggs in one basket.  That's not\njust bad marketing, that's bad business.\n\nThe moment we start commoditizing and templating what should be more creativity\nthan anything is the moment we destroy it.\n\nWhat happens in 99% of these templated relationships is that the client ends up\npaying for something that they can barely afford or understand.  It\\ yields\nlittle to no lasting results, or mediocre results that stop as soon as they stop\npaying. There is no originality in any of their advertising or campaigns. There\nis no genuine thought leadership. Hell, there is no original thought. It’s\nmarketing on the rinse-and-repeat cycle.\n\nWhat was and still could be the industry with the most opportunity to evolve our\nsociety as a whole, is also the one responsible for society’s regression.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked the \"long answer,\" check out the book written by our CEO, Bad\nMarketing:  Our industry is turning into a monster!\n[https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Marketing-industry-turning-monster-ebook/dp/B08511CSC4/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=bad+marketing&qid=1582857549&sr=8-2]","published_at":"2020-12-07T16:55:00.000-05:00","created_at":"2021-06-11T17:55:31.000-04:00","reading_time":2,"slug":"what-industries-does-oakwave-service","tags":[{"name":"business","slug":"business","url":"https://blog.oakwave.com/tag/business/"},{"name":"service","slug":"service","url":"https://blog.oakwave.com/tag/service/"},{"name":"industries","slug":"industries","url":"https://blog.oakwave.com/tag/industries/"}],"url":"https://blog.oakwave.com/what-industries-does-oakwave-service/","id":"Ghost__Post__60c3dbd3223688243ba0e0c7"}},{"node":{"html":"<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><ol><li>There’s a very real almost 70% chance that you will fail.</li><li>Not everyone should be in business.
