Why on earth would anyone buy from you?\n\nIt ain’t your friendly customer service, buck-o.\n\nDon’t write this off as one of those frilly things that don’t affect your\nbusiness.  A strong competitive differentiation is the most critical component\nto the future success of any organization.  In its simplest form, this is\nanswering “why would a customer choose my company?”  Competitive differentiation\nis the only element that consistently distinguishes you from similar competitors\nand gives the buyer a compelling reason to select you.  It doesn’t matter how\nunique your idea is or how amazing your hair looks, lack of a strong competitive\ndifferentiation will prohibit you from acquiring and/or retaining business.\n\nIn order for a competitive differentiation to be market viable, all three of the\nfollowing must be true:\n\n * Relevant to the market\n * Not easily replicated\n * Verifiable/actually true\n\nThose three constraints, should they all be held true, limit the possibility of\ndifferentiation to something more manageable.  Here are the categories of\ndifferentiation or mechanisms by which an organization may answer “why?”:\n\n * Product Differentiation - Examples include performance, features, design,\n   etc.\n * Service Differentiation - Examples include warranty, ordering ease,\n   installation, convenience, etc.\n * Relationship Differentiation - Examples include great customer service,\n   courtesy, credibility, responsiveness, etc.\n * Brand/Reputation Differentiation - Examples include social perception,\n   communication, marketing, advertising\n * Price Differentiation - Examples include budget/low pricing, high pricing for\n   exclusivity, etc.\n * Distribution Differentiation - Examples include delivery speed, delivery\n   method, etc.\n\nIt’s worth noting that about 80% of the clients that I have ever interacted with\nlist “customer service” as their primary differentiator.  Rarely, and I do mean\nrarely, is this actually true.\n\nCustomer service as a differentiation can exist, but it has to be absolutely\namazing to be a differentiator.  Think Trader Joe’s, Amazon, and Costco.  All\nthree of those are ceaselessly committed to the customer’s satisfaction to their\nown loss at times.  They are actually globally known for their exceptional\ncustomer service, yet they do not rely upon that as their chief differentiation.\n That’s the caliber that one must think of when considering customer service as\na competitive differentiation.\n\nThough it is a deviation from conventional wisdom, in today’s markets, price and\nproduct do not pass the litmus test 99% of the time as viable or long-term\ncompetitive differentiations either.  They are both easily replicable.\n Distribution is doable, but very tricky, given the Amazon Prime culture that we\nhave groomed over the last decade.\n\nAn organization that I worked with, prior to Amazon’s prevalence as the ONLY\nsubscription distribution method in town, differentiated themselves by offering\na product that your home needed regularly on a subscription model.  You would\nsubscribe to their service and every few months, when your home needed this\nparticular product changed, a replacement product would show up at your door.\n They did so well at this type of fulfillment and people wanted it so much that\nthe company was able to close three funding rounds successfully and hire 125\nsouls aboard that Titanic of a startup.\n\nIn December of 2019, they laid off half the company.  I doubt the organization\nwill see 2021.\n\nWhen I worked with that company, I begged them to diversify their offering and\nmodel, as Amazon had just started heavily pushing consumers towards the\nSubscribe-And-Save program at the time.  I felt like Subscribe-And-Save would\nput this company out of business, as why on earth would anyone sign up for their\nservice when you could get the same thing with Subscribe-And-Save without\nmaintaining yet another subscription with another no-name company.  The\norganization’s leadership balked at me and touted their brand value and that\npeople would stay.\n\nFast forward five or so years and two rebrands for that company, and the writing\nis on the wall.  It’s unfortunate, as in a situation like that, being the\n“doomsday herald” isn’t a pleasurable job.  Saying “I told you so,” is the least\nrewarding thing in the world.  That company was attempting to use distribution\nas a differentiator and didn’t incorporate or account for Amazon into their\noverall strategy,  This was their death warrant and absolutely heartbreaking.\n In the case of price as a differentiator (coupons, value, etc.), companies gain\na transaction, not a customer, when you undercut the rest of the market.\n\nIf there is a universal truth to be had in business and marketing it is this:\n someone will always have a cheaper product or newer widget than yours.  Price\nand product as differentiators never hold water because of this.  They simply\naren’t lasting values that answer “why should the target market buy from me?” in\na way that can outlast fluctuating markets.\n\nService, relationship, and brand/reputation differentiation are the most\nsustainable and successful differentiation.  If you wanted the cheapest TV you\ncould purchase for your daughter’s treehouse, would you even remember the brand\nname, barring any extraneous circumstances?  However, if you were buying a new\nTV for your living room, do you immediately go to price?  Or do you have some\nbuilt-in loyalty for Samsung, LG, Phillips, etc.?  Whether the purchase is B2B,\nB2C, B2B2C, product-based, service-based, or any other possible combination that\ncan be imagined, an individual with human-purchasing-patterns makes the buying\ndecision.\n\nIf a target market is not moved by saturation, wouldn’t price move them? Either\nby elitist, exclusive pricing (a la Gucci, Louis Vuitton, etc.) or\nbottom-of-the-barrel discount pricing (a la  Family Dollar, Budget Rent-a-car,\netc.)?  Sure, but that movement is tied so intrinsically with pricing that it\nhas no staying power whatsoever.\n\nFor B2B organizations, the answer largely relies upon relationship and\nbrand/reputation differentiation.  How does one market a relationship\ndifferentiation or actually achieve brand/reputation differentiation?\n\nOrganizations will simply not be able to succeed in evolving markets without a\nstrengthened, consistent competitive differentiation that emotionally moves\ntheir target market. This has to be more than words.  It has to be something\ntruly different.  And it can’t be bullshit.","html":"<p>THE POWER OF 'WHY' (SHOULD YOUR BUYER CHOOSE YOU) COMPELS YOU!</p><blockquote><em><em>“And the enemy is one time I ain't gotta tell you</em></em><br><em><em>It's right in front of your eyes.”</em></em><br><em><em>-Mobb Deep, “Hell on Earth”</em></em></blockquote><p>The root of all good marketing, the literal heart of it, is your competitive differentiation.
