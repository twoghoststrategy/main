You can stumble across what are often considered to be respectable\nconversion rates in the single digits.\n\nDifferent lengths and types of content appeal to different users, and it is\nimportant to populate your website and blog with these types of content in order\nto reach the widest audience possible. Here are the four types of internet users\nalong with the content that appeals to each.\n\nStreakers\nStreakers are just what they sound like. These are internet users who are\nstreaking through a search on the net, looking for a quick answer or a fast\nsolution to a problem. They are often looking to make a purchase whether\npre-planned or impulse and are just following through on a decision they’ve\nalready made.\n\nAlternatively, they are looking for a simple answer such as “How long do you\nboil an egg?” The key to getting this user’s attention is to have the best\nanswer to their question, or the quickest and best checkout with the briefest\nproduct description.\n\nWhile studies show that if a web page takes more than four seconds to load, the\nuser will go somewhere else for answers, with the streaker it is often even\nquicker than that. You have only a second or two to get and hold their\nattention, and in order to earn a click in the first place, you must be in one\nof the top spots on Google. Users who go to page 2 are rare, but streakers never\ndo.\n\nShort form content, fast loading pages, quick answers, simple shopping and\ncheckout features, brief product descriptions, and short video clips and even\nsmall infographics or photo essays all appeal to streakers. Content that takes\njust a moment to browse and understand is the best way to reach them.\n\nStrollers\nStrollers are not in a huge hurry like their streaker counterparts, however,\nthey are also not invested in a multiple-thread, lengthy search. Sometimes a\nstroller does not exactly know what they are looking for yet. They are at the\npoint in the sales funnel where they know they have a want or need but have no\nclue what the solution might be.\n\nIn some cases, they may also not know they have a want or need, and by\nattracting their attention, you may be able to show it to them. Think of the\nstroller as a window shopper. Your objective is to attract and hold their\nattention.\n\nThe thing about strollers is that they are easily distracted. Appealing to them\nmeans medium form, medium length content, but it must also be well-written and\ninformative content that is visually appealing and accurate. They will get bored\nwith content that is too long and will close tabs quickly on content that is\nsuperficial.\n\nStudiers\nThe studier is different. This is a person who knows they have a want or a need\nbut is into looking at all of their options. Price is not a factor for them in\nmost cases, but features, reviews, detailed descriptions, and comparisons to\nsimilar products matter more.\n\nThis is the user who often conducts multi-thread searches with different\nkeywords and phrases they use to narrow the results. Well-written long-form\ncontent goes a long way. Fluff content will earn a bounce and a “never visit\nyour site again” result.\n\nThe kicker is as these users search and study, they are more likely to share or\nlink to your content than others. Not only are they vested in their own\nsolutions, they often like to share these solutions with others. If your content\nappeals to them and you have a good product to back it up, they will become your\ngreatest ambassadors. Let them down, and well, things will go the opposite\ndirection.\n\nStudiers may leave your site and return after more research. Being an expert on\nyour subject and providing informative content is the key to winning them over.\n\nResearchers\nResearchers are the least common type of internet users, almost studiers on\nsteroids. They are often students, journalists, or academics. They will share\nyour content, but they are looking for fact-based and source backed materials.\nWhite papers, case studies, long-form articles, in-depth tutorials, and more\nappeal to them.\n\nYour site will often earn links from researchers, as they will cite your work if\nit is authoritative enough yet engaging. These links will often be from\nhigh-authority sites that will boost your Google rankings and increase organic\ntraffic. These links are typically relevant, and can actually earn you direct\nclicks too.\n\nThe idea behind knowing these users is to understand that you can structure\ncontent to appeal to them, but ideally you will convert streakers to strollers,\nslowing them down on your site. You will convert strollers to studiers, and\nstudiers to researchers.\n\nAs you understand these types, you will better understand your marketing\npersonas. This understanding will help you formulate and execute a content\nmarketing strategy that will yield real results.\n\nYou can either stumble across decent conversion numbers, or you can be a rock\nstar by appealing to all of the types of internet users, making your content\ndesirable to all of them.","html":"<p><br><br>If you have no idea what (or who) you are aiming for, you won’t even know if you hit them.
