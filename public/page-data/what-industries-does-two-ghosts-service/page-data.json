Basically, a client is paying a lower price for access to a template, or formula, by which they can execute their marketing. Since this template has literally zero emotional connection with the target audience and is reused over and over and over, it is effective at the moment it is being executed (if the odds are in your favor) and ineffective in building the brand or anything with staying power.
