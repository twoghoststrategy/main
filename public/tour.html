        The `id` attribute of the step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it's optional.
        If it is not defined, it will get a default value of `step-N` where N is a number of slide.

        So in the example below it'll be `step-2`.

        The hash part of the url when this step is active will be `#/step-2`.

        You can also use `#step-2` in a link, to point directly to this particular step.

        Please note, that while `#/step-2` (with slash) would also work in a link it's not recommended.
        Using classic `id`-based links like `#step-2` makes these links usable also in fallback mode.

        This step here doesn't introduce anything new when it comes to data attributes, but you
        should notice in the demo that some words of this text are being animated.
        It's a very basic CSS transition that is applied to the elements when this step element is
        reached.

        At the very beginning of the presentation all step elements are given the class of `future`.
        It means that they haven't been visited yet.

        When the presentation moves to given step `future` is changed to `present` class name.
        That's how animation on this step works - text moves when the step has `present` class.

        Finally when the step is left the `present` class is removed from the element and `past`
        class is added.

        So basically every step element has one of three classes: `future`, `present` and `past`.
        Only one current step has the `present` class.

        Note: data-x/y/z attributes, if not defined, by default will inherit the value of the
        previous step. So to get back to 0 on the z-axis, we must set it to 0.
        See src/plugins/rel/README.md for more information.

        And the last one shows full power and flexibility of impress.js.

        You can not only position element in 3D, but also rotate it around any axis.
        So this one here will get rotated by -40 degrees (40 degrees anticlockwise) around X axis and
        10 degrees (clockwise) around Y axis.

        You can of course rotate it around Z axis with `data-rotate-z` - it has exactly the same effect
        as `data-rotate` (these two are basically aliases).

    <!--

        So to summarize of all the possible attributes used to position presentation steps, we have:

        * `data-x`, `data-y`, `data-z` - they define the position of **the center** of step element on
            the canvas in pixels; their default value is 0;
        * `data-rotate-x`, `data-rotate-y`, 'data-rotate-z`, `data-rotate` - they define the rotation of
            the element around given axis in degrees; their default value is 0; `data-rotate` and `data-rotate-z`
            are exactly the same;
        * `data-scale` - defines the scale of step element; default value is 1

        These values are used by impress.js in CSS transformation functions, so for more information consult
        CSS transfrom docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/transform

    This is a UI plugin. You can read more about plugins in src/plugins/README.md.
    For now, I'll just tell you that this adds some graphical controls to navigate the
    presentation. In the CSS file you can style them as you want. We've put them bottom right.

    Hint is not related to impress.js in any way.

    But it can show you how to use impress.js features in creative way.

    When the presentation step is shown (selected) its element gets the class of "active" and the body element
    gets the class based on active step id `impress-on-ID` (where ID is the step's id)... It may not be
    so clear because of all these "ids" in previous sentence, so for example when the first step (the one with
    the id of `bored`) is active, body element gets a class of `impress-on-bored`.

    This class is used by this hint below. Check CSS file to see how it's shown with delayed CSS animation when
    the first step of presentation is visible for a couple of seconds.

    ...

    And when it comes to this piece of JavaScript below ... kids, don't do this at home ;)
    It's just a quick and dirty workaround to get different hint text for touch devices.
    In a real world it should be at least placed in separate JS file ... and the touch content should be
    probably just hidden somewhere in HTML - not hard-coded in the script.

    Just sayin' ;)

-->
<div class="hint">
    <p>Use a spacebar or arrow keys to navigate. <br/>
       Press 'P' to launch speaker console.</p>
</div>
<script>
if ("ontouchstart" in document.documentElement) {
    document.querySelector(".hint").innerHTML = "<p>Swipe left or right to navigate</p>";
}
</script>

<!--

    Last, but not least.

    To make all described above really work, you need to include impress.js in the page.
    I strongly encourage to minify it first.

    In here I just include full source of the script to make it more readable.

    You also need to call a `impress().init()` function to initialize impress.js presentation.
    And you should do it in the end of your document. Not only because it's a good practice, but also
    because it should be done when the whole document is ready.
    Of course you can wrap it in any kind of "DOM ready" event, but I was too lazy to do so ;)

-->
<script src="js/impress.js"></script>
<script>impress().init();</script>

<!--

    The `impress()` function also gives you access to the API that controls the presentation.

    Just store the result of the call:

        var api = impress();

    and you will get three functions you can call:

        `api.init()` - initializes the presentation,
        `api.next()` - moves to next step of the presentation,
        `api.prev()` - moves to previous step of the presentation,
        `api.goto( stepIndex | stepElementId | stepElement, [duration] )` - moves the presentation to the step given by its index number
                id or the DOM element; second parameter can be used to define duration of the transition in ms,
                but it's optional - if not provided default transition duration for the presentation will be used.

    You can also simply call `impress()` again to get the API, so `impress().next()` is also allowed.
    Don't worry, it wont initialize the presentation again.

    For some example uses of this API check the last part of the source of impress.js where the API
    is used in event handlers.
